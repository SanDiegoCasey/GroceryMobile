Grocery Mobile is a shopping companion app that operates both as a shopping list but also a price comparison list so you can quickly add products to your list that you purchase frequently and compare the prices that you have entered into the app from each of the stores.  This is extremely helpful for people who shop frequently from a couple of different stores, and forget which is the cheapest for which items.
