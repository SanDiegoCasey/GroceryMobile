				<h3>Adding Stores</h3>

					<span class="instructions-button"><img src="images/icons/icon-shop-white.png" alt="New Store Button"></span>
					Your first step will be choosing your favorite stores that you frequent.  Click on the green store button and choose your 3 primary
					stores. You can also go here at any time to make changes to your stores and keep all that stores records if you would prefer to use a different store for a while in your top 3.
				</p>
				<h3>Your List</h3>
				<p class="aboutpage"><span class="instructions-button"><img src="images/icons/icon-list-white.png" alt="List button"></span>
					Once you have a few stores, and some products, you can proceed to your list.  This is where the app will usually take you when you first login. You can always add products right
					from the list page by just clicking the "new" button.  You can also add previous items from the drop down list using the green checkmark.
				</p>
				<p class="aboutpage">
					Once you have a few items in your grocery list and you're at the grocery store you will be able to check items off of your list with the checkbox. Once an item is checked off you can
					also delete it from your list which will put it into your drop down to use for another time.
				</p>
				<p class="aboutpage">
					Anytime you need to update the prices for a product, simply click the green pencil arrow and you will be able to edit the product pricing and also the unit used to measure it.
				</p>
				<h3>Adding / Editing Products</h3>
				<p class="aboutpage">
					<span class="instructions-button"><img src="images/icons/icon-apple-white.png" alt="New Store Button"></span>
					Adding and editing products and their current prices is the fun part! You can either do this at home with the weekly paper, or with a recent receipt or at the store with the
					app on your phone. Simply click the Green Apple Icon at the bottom, or the "new" button on your list, or click the green pencil edit button on an existing item.
				</p>
				<p class="aboutpage">
					From the add prouct or edit page, choose the type of unit you will use to determine the price and enter in the prices for that item at 1 or all of your favorite stores.  If you
					are comparing different products with different measurements you can use the easy conversion calculator at the bottom.
